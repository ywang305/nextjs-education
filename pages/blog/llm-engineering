| **Performance Metrics** | Latency, throughput (requests/second), token generation speed; influenced by instance type and TGI configurations. Sagemaker provides metrics for monitoring. | Latency, throughput, token generation speed; influenced by instance type and LMI configurations and underlying inference library. Sagemaker provides metrics. | Latency, throughput, token generation speed; directly dependent on EC2 instance, vLLM configuration, and network. Requires manual setup for monitoring. | Latency, throughput, token generation speed; influenced by EKS node type, vLLM configuration, and Kubernetes networking. Monitoring can be integrated with EKS tools. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Sagemaker offers managed scaling, potentially optimizing costs by scaling down during low traffic. Cost depends on instance type and usage. Alternatives (EC2, EKS) require more manual optimization but offer direct control over instance selection and lifecycle. Sagemaker might have overhead costs for the managed service. | Similar to Hugging Face on Sagemaker. Cost depends on instance type and usage. LMI containers aim for efficiency. Alternatives require manual optimization but offer direct control. Sagemaker has managed service overhead. | Direct EC2 offers potentially lower costs with careful instance selection and utilization, but requires managing infrastructure. No Sagemaker managed service overhead. | EKS involves costs for control plane and worker nodes. Autoscaling can optimize costs based on demand, but requires configuration. No direct Sagemaker costs. |
| **Latest Feature: Multi-LoRA Support** | Availability depends on the underlying Hugging Face TGI version used by Sagemaker at this time (April 28, 2025). Check Sagemaker documentation for the latest TGI features. | Availability depends on the underlying inference library (e.g., vLLM) within the DJL LMI container and how DJL exposes this functionality. Check AWS and DJL documentation for the latest features. | vLLM has introduced multi-LoRA support. You would have immediate access to this feature by deploying the latest version on your EC2 instance. | vLLM within EKS would also have access to multi-LoRA support if you deploy the latest vLLM version in your containers. Kubernetes facilitates managing the deployment. |
| **Managing CI/CD** | Sagemaker Model Registry and MLOps features can be used for model versioning and deployment pipelines, but CI/CD for the underlying inference service code requires separate setup (e.g., using SageMaker Pipelines or external CI/CD tools). | Similar to Hugging Face on Sagemaker, leveraging Sagemaker MLOps for model management, with separate CI/CD for code. | Requires manual setup of CI/CD pipelines for model updates and infrastructure changes (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins). | EKS integrates well with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Argo CD for managing application and infrastructure deployments, including vLLM updates. |
